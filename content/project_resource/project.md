## A
* [Alzheimer's disease (AD) gene mapping in multi-ethnic families](https://github.com/cumc/lab-wiki/tree/master/private/project/family-gene-mapping.md). The project aims to identify novel AD targets using WGS and WES data from >1000 AD families.
	* **Justin Adam Ghaeli and Tabassum Fabiha**.
* [Alzhemier's disease risk prediction and feature discovery](https://github.com/cumc/lab-wiki/tree/master/private/project/alzheimer-deep.md). This project aims to profile Alzhemier's disease risk factors through integrating genomic sequence features and their health records.
	* **Rachita Naik and Xinqi Li**.
* [Association studies of pleiotropic variants: candidate region analysis](https://github.com/cumc/lab-wiki/tree/master/private/project/candidate-regions.md). For given regions of interest across multiple phenotypes, a number of statistical workflows will be developed for fine-mapping, pleiotropy, and mediation analysis.
	* **Olivia Wagner, Sibei Liu and Riva Jia**.
* [Association studies of pleiotropic variants: candidate region discovery](https://github.com/cumc/lab-wiki/tree/master/private/project/ukbb-scan.md). This project aims to elucidate variants which play a role in pleiotropy for complex diseases and traits with high public health significance.
	* **Diana Cornejo, Haoyue Shuai, Ran Wang, Sibei Liu and Riva Jia**.

## D
* [Dynamic statistical comparisons](https://github.com/cumc/lab-wiki/tree/master/private/project/dsc.md). This is continued development of the [DSC](https://stephenslab.github.io/dsc-wiki/overview) software for benchmarking computational experiments in statistics and computational biology.
	* **Manxueying Li, Junyang Jin and Gao Wang**.

## F
* [Family-based association study design](https://github.com/cumc/lab-wiki/tree/master/private/project/family-association.md). An empirical study of several flavors of family-based vs population-based design to examine each of their advantages.
	* **Diana Cornejo, Duzhi Zhao, and Jinhee Choi**.
* [Fine-mapping methods](https://github.com/cumc/lab-wiki/tree/master/private/project/fine-mapping.md). This project looks into fine-mapping in families, cross populations, with functional annotations and with multiple phenotypes.
	* **Gao Wang**.
* [Fine-mapping with genomic annotations](https://github.com/cumc/lab-wiki/tree/master/private/project/finemap-annotation.md). A preliminary numerical study on how genomic annotations help with fine-mapping performance.
	* **Gao Wang**.
* [Functional genomics annotation and prediction in brains](https://github.com/cumc/lab-wiki/tree/master/private/project/molecular-deep.md). Integration of functional annotation and molecular phenotype (including proteomic data) for brain disease associations, including building prediction models using deep learning.
	* **Anmol Singh and Ashvin Jagadeesan (AJ)**.

## G
* [Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in age-related hearing impairment and tinnitus](https://github.com/cumc/lab-wiki/tree/master/private/project/ge-interaction.md). Development of statistical workflows for gene by gene, gene by environment, gene by age and gene by sex interactions, with applications to complex traits association analysis.
	* **TBD**.

## M
* [Molecular phenotype association mapping and GWAS integration in Alzheimer's disease (AD)](https://github.com/cumc/lab-wiki/tree/master/private/project/xqtl-gwas.md). This project aims to identify genomic targets for Alzheimer's disease through integration of a range of molecular phenotypes and AD GWAS data.
	* **Yuqi Miao**.
* [Molecular phenotype prediction and association mapping for Alzheimer's disease (AD)](https://github.com/cumc/lab-wiki/tree/master/private/project/xqtl-twas.md). This project leverages available molecular phenotype data in brains to perform TWAS for AD, in a variety of AD cohorts.
	* **Hao Sun**.
* [Multiple imputation (MI) for association analysis of imputed genotypes](https://github.com/cumc/lab-wiki/tree/master/private/project/multiple-imputation.md). Instead of analyzing genotype dosages, this project applies MI to perform association testing with imputed genotypes, providing statistical evidence of association while quantifying the reliability of the genetic data.
	* **Paul Auer and Suzanne Leal**.

## S
* [SEQSpark](https://github.com/cumc/lab-wiki/tree/master/private/project/seqspark.md). Association analysis software using Apache Spark, customized for analysis tasks performed in our group.
	* **Shiv Venkatagiri, Hyun Soo Jeon, Linxiao Wu and Zixuan Zhang**.
