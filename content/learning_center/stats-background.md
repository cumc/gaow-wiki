# Introductory books on statistics

## Paper text books
- Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning for Molecular Biology
    - By Alan Moses
- Statistical Inference (2nd Edition)
    - By Casella and Berger
    - An introductory book to mathematical statistics: probability, distributions, MLE and significance testing
- Statistical Rethinking (2nd Edition)
    - Written by a scientist this is a good Bayesian inference book for scientists (and perhaps not statisticians) with a little bit statistics and computing background
    - Designed for sequential (study from the beginning to the end) not random (read about certain topics) access 
    - [Youtube lectures available](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJK6_DZvcMqNSzQdEkzvzA)
